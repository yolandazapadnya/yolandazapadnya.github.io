# About me
My name is <span class="my-name">Yolanda Xavier</span>. Currently — in 2026 — I am a last-year PhD candidate in Psycholinguistics at the Research Center for Linguistics at NOVA University Lisbon, Portugal. My research borders the Psycholinguistic and Sociolinguistic aspects, since I am investigating the perception of native European Portuguese speakers towards different non-native speakers productions in relation to specific acoustic cues, namely nasal and oral vowels. As such, I examine if the non-native production of nasal and oral vowels in European Portuguese can lead to lower employability ratings for the non-native speakers, specifically for the access to the higher-level positions. I am mainly working with Ukrainian with additional languages — French and Chinese — serving as complementary fillers. Besides this, my research is multifaceted, since it englobes acoustic analysis of formants, vowel duration, syllable duration, and intensity, as well as structured experimental design to elicit implicit language attitudes. 

## Main skills
I am writing my PhD thesis in LaTeX.
My statistical analysis is done with R in RStudio: lme4, ggplot2, mclogit, and similar.
I have some side projects that I do in Python in VS Code. You can check them on my GitHub page.
I know advanced Praat (can work with different Praat scripts): formant analysis, duration (vowel and syllable), and pitch; I can also segment vowels via script and label tiers. 
I can do advanced experiments in Gorilla Experiment Builder.

## Past life
I am a former triple and long jumper:
